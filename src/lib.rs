//! # GGRS
//! GGRS (good game rollback system) is a reimagination of the GGPO network SDK written in 100% safe Rust ðŸ¦€.
//! The callback-style API from the original library has been replaced with a much saner, simpler control flow.
//! Instead of registering callback functions, GGRS returns a list of requests for the user to fulfill.

/// and expected that some predictions will be incorrect, but the more incorrect predictions are
/// given to GGRS, the more work your game will have to do to resimulate the game state (and the
/// more that rollbacks may be noticeable to your human players).

///
/// * GGRS will make it seem to your game as if all remote players crouch on every frame.
/// * When GGRS receives input from a remote player and finds out they are not crouching, it will
///   ask your game to rollback to the frame that input was from and resimulate it plus all
///   subsequent frames up to and including the present frame.
/// * Therefore 99% of frames will be resimulated.

/// This is a good default choice, and a sane starting point for any custom input prediction logic.
///
/// # Improving Prediction Accuracy
///
/// ## Quantize Inputs
///
/// This predictor works best if your inputs are discrete (or quantized), as this increases the
/// chances of them being the same from frame to frame.
///
/// For example, say your game allows players to move forward or stand still using an analog
/// joystick; here are two ways you could represent player input:
///
/// * `moving_forward: bool` set to `true` when the joystick is pressed forward and `false`
///   otherwise.
/// * `forward_speed: f32` with a range from `0.0` to `1.0` depending on how far the joystick is
///   pressed forward.
///
/// The former works well with this predictor, but the (fairly) continuous nature of a 32-bit
/// floating point number plus the precision of an analog joystick plus the inability of most humans
/// to hold a joystick perfectly still means that the value of `forward_speed` from one frame to the
/// next will almost always differ; this in turn will cause many mispredictions when used with this
/// input predictor.
///
/// Hence, when using this predictor there is generally a tradeoff between input precision and
/// prediction accuracy, with the right choice depending on the game's design:
///
/// * in a keyboard-only game, move-forward input is likely a binary "move or not" anyway, so this
///   predictor is perfectly suited.
/// * in a 2D fighting game played with analog joysticks, it might be fine for movement to be
/// represented as "stand still", "walk forward", and "run forward" based on how far the joystick is
/// pressed forward.
/// * in a platformer played with analog joysticks, 5 to 10 discrete moving forward speeds may be
///   required in order for the game to feel precise enough.
///
/// ## Store State, Not Transitions
///
/// This predictor works best if your input captures the current state of player input, rather than
/// a transition between states.
///
/// For example, say your game allows players to hold a button to crouch; here are two ways you
/// could represent player input:
///
/// * state-based: `crouching_button_held`, set to `true` as long as the player is crouching
/// * transition-based: `crouching_button_pressed` and `crouching_button_released`, which are set to
///   true on the frames where the player first presses and and releases the crouch button
///   (respectively)
///
/// Given a sequence of these inputs over time, these two representations capture the same
/// information (with some bookkeeping, your game can trivially convert between the two). But,
/// consider a single instance of a player crouching for several frames in a row:
///
/// In the first case, the input predictor will make two mispredictions: once on the first frame
/// when crouching begins, and once on the last frame when the player releases the crouch button.
///
/// But in the second case, the input predictor will make four mispredictions:
///
/// * When the player first presses the crouch button
/// * The frame immediately after the crouch button was pressed
/// * When the player releases the crouch button
/// * The frame immediately after the crouch button was released
///
/// Therefore, this input is better suited to the state-based representation.
