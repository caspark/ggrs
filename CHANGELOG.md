# Changelog

In this document, all remarkable changes are listed. Not mentioned are smaller code cleanups or documentation improvements.

## Unreleased

- allow non-`Clone` types to be stored in `GameStateCell`.
- added `SyncTestSession::current_frame()` and `SpectatorSession::current_frame()` to match the existing `P2PSession::current_frame()`.
- added `P2PSession::desync_detection()` to read the session's desync detection mode.

## 0.10.2

- fix dependency versions

## 0.10.1

- SyncTest now checks frames in chronological order

## 0.10.0

- Rename types with GGRS prefix to match rust naming conventions
- Removed deprecated `GgrsError` variants
- `GameStateCell` now implements debug.
- fixed a bug where checksums of unconfirmed frames were compared during desync detection.
- You can now trigger a desync manually in the example game by pressing SPACE.

## 0.9.4

- `SessionBuilder` now implements debug. This requires `Config::Address` to have Debug
- Optional desync detection for p2p sessions. This feature can be used by using `with_desync_detection_mode` in the `SessionBuilder`.

## 0.9.3

- added support for fieldless enums in `PlayerInput`

## 0.9.2

- fixed a bug where sync would not work with RTT higher than SYNC_RETRY_INTERVAL

## 0.9.1

- fixed multiple local players, added example documentation for it
- fixed save and advance request ordering during a rollback in P2PSessions

## 0.9.0

- removed `GameState` from the public API.
- removed `PlayerInput` from the public API. `AdvanceFrame` requests will now hand over a tuple with the `InputStatus` and status of that input
- added `InputStatus` enum to distinguish the status of given inputs
- users now have to call `add_local_input(..)` for every local player before calling `advance_frame()`
- enabled multiple players per endpoint
- sessions are now constructed through a unified `SessionBuilder`
- overhauled all generics
- provided inputs are now generic. The user has to only supply a POD struct instead of serialized input
- added a `Config` trait with types to bundle all generic options
- renamed `GameInput` to `PlayerInput`
- the user now has to explicitly create a socket themselves before creating a session

## 0.8.0

- `GameState` now is a generic `GameState<T: Clone = Vec<u8>>`, so serialization of game state to save and load is no longer required
- `trait NonBlockingSocket` now is a generic `NonBlockingSocket<A>`, where `A` generalizes the address that the socket uses to send a packet.

## 0.7.2

- massively improved performance by improving input packet handling

## 0.7.1

- added getter for the max prediction frames parameter in `P2PSession` and `SyncTestSession`

## 0.7.0

- removed the const `MAX_PREDICTION_FRAMES` and made it a parameter for the user to choose

## 0.6.0

- added `P2PSession::current_frame()`
- made `P2PSession::confirmed_frame()` public to let users access it
- removed the need for a player cap and a maximum input size
- adjusted session creation API to reflect the above change
- fixed a bug where a p2p session without remote players would not start
- migrated to rust 2021

## 0.5.1

- ggrs no longer panics when packets have been tampered with
- added `P2PSession::frames_ahead()` that shows how many frames the session believes to be ahead of other sessions.

## 0.5.0

- renamed session constructors to make them more idiomatic. Sessions are now created through `P2PSession::new(...)` and `P2PSession::new_with_socket(...)`.
- added functions to create sessions with own sockets provided
- turned NonBlockingSocket into a trait to allow alternate socket types in the future.
- fixed a bug where calling network_stats without any time passed would lead to a division by 0.
- fixed a bug where packet transmission time would be accounted for with RTT instead of RTT / 2

## 0.4.4

- fixed a bug where p2p sessions would falsely skip frames even when there able to run the frame
- implemented some first steps towards WASM compatibility

## 0.4.3

- changed license from MIT to MIT or Apache 2.0 at the users option
- added `local_player_handle()` to `P2PSession`, which returns the handle of the local player
- added `set_fps(desired_fps)` to `P2PSpectatorSession`

## 0.4.2

- users are now allowed to save `None` buffers for a `GgrsRequest::SaveRequest`. This allows users to keep their own state history and load/save more efficiently
- added `num_players()`, `input_size()` getters to all sessions

## 0.4.1

- added sparse saving feature `P2PSession`, minimizing the SaveState requests to a bare minimum at the cost of potentially longer rollbacks
- added `set_sparse_saving()` to `P2PSession` to enable sparse saving
- added `set_fps(desired_fps)` to `P2PSession` for the user to set expected update frequency. This is helpful for frame synchronization between sessions
- fixed a bug where a spectator would not handle disconnected players correctly with more than two players
- fixed a bug where changes to `disconnect_timeout` and `disconnect_notify_start` would change existings endpoints, but would not influence endpoints created afterwards
- expanded the BoxGame example for up to four players and as many spectators as wanted
- minor code optimizations

## 0.4.0

- spectators catch up by advancing the frame twice per `advance_frame(...)` call, if too far behind
- added `frames_behind_host()` to `P2PSpectatorSession`, allowing to query how many frames the spectator client is behind the last received input
- added `set_max_frames_behind(desired_value)`to `P2PSpectatorSession`, allowing to set after how many frames behind the spectator fast-forwards to catch up
- added `set_catchup_speed(desired_value)` to `P2PSpectatorSession`, allowing to set how many frames the spectator catches up per `advance_frame()` call, if too far behind
- in `SyncTestSession`, the user now can (and has to) provide input for all players in order to advance the frame

## 0.3.0

- `GgrsError::InvalidRequest` now has an added `info` field to explain the problem in more detail
- removed unused `GgrsError::GeneralFailure`
- removed multiple methods in `SyncTestSession`, as they didn't fulfill any meaningful purpose
- removed unused sequence number from message header, fixing related issues
- fixed an issue where out-of-order packets would cause a crash
- other minor improvements

## 0.2.5

- when a player disconnects, the other players now rollback to that frame. This is done in order to eliminate wrong predictions and resimulate the game with correct disconnection indicators
- spectators now also handle those disconnections correctly

## 0.2.4

- fixed an issue where the spectator would assign wrong frames to the input
- players disconnecting now leads to a rollback to the disconnect frame, so wrongly made predictions can be removed
- in the box game example, disconnected players now spin
- minor code and documentation cleanups

## 0.2.3

- fixed an issue where encoding/decoding reference would not match, leading to client desyncs

## 0.2.2

- SyncTestSession now actually compares checksums again
- if the user doesn't provide checksums, GGRS computes a fletcher16 checksum
- internal refactoring/renaming

## 0.2.1

- fixed an issue where the spectator would only handle one UDP packet and drop the rest

## 0.2.0

- Reworked API: Instead of the user passing a GGRSInterface trait object, GGRS now returns a list of GgrsRequests for the user to fulfill
